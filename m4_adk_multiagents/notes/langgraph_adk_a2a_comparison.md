## 1. Google ADK Orchestration

Google ADK provides built-in orchestrator agent types for composing multi-agent workflows.

In this workshop's Module 4, we use ADK primarily as the **agent runtime layer** (`LlmAgent` + `MCPToolset` + `Runner`) behind an A2A HTTP boundary, not as an in-process ADK orchestrator hierarchy.

### Built-in agent/orchestrator patterns

- `SequentialAgent` — runs sub-agents one after another (pipeline)
- `ParallelAgent` — runs sub-agents concurrently
- `LoopAgent` — repeats sub-agents until iteration/termination criteria are met
- `LlmAgent` — can act as a router/coordinator using LLM reasoning to choose among tools/sub-agents

The model is hierarchical: orchestrators are agents that contain other agents.

For custom routing logic, subclass `BaseAgent` and override `_run_async_impl`.

## 2. LangGraph Orchestration

LangGraph uses an explicit graph model.

### Core mechanics

- Agents/functions are graph nodes
- Routing logic is encoded as edges (including conditional edges)
- Shared state flows through a `StateGraph`

This makes cycles, branching, and stateful decisions explicit and inspectable.

Practical tradeoff:
- More verbose setup
- Usually easier to reason about complex routing and termination behavior

## 3. ADK vs LangGraph (Side-by-Side)

| Feature | LangGraph | Google ADK |
|---|---|---|
| Model | Explicit graph (nodes/edges) | Hierarchical agent composition |
| Sequential flows | Linear/ordered graph paths | `SequentialAgent` |
| Parallel execution | Parallel node branches | `ParallelAgent` |
| Conditional routing | Conditional edges/router functions | `LlmAgent` routing or custom `BaseAgent` |
| Looping | Cycles in graph | `LoopAgent` |
| State management | `StateGraph` shared state | Session + `InvocationContext` |
| Complexity | More setup, more explicit | Simpler defaults, less explicit flow surface |

Both are in-process, single-framework orchestration approaches **when** you choose to orchestrate inside one runtime.
In Module 4, orchestration is intentionally moved to an HTTP A2A loop so buyer and seller can run as independent networked services.

## 4. A2A Protocol

A2A (Agent-to-Agent) is Google’s open protocol for cross-framework, cross-system agent communication over HTTP.

### Key protocol concepts

- Each agent publishes an Agent Card (`/.well-known/agent-card.json`) describing capabilities
- Agents exchange standardized task requests/responses (JSON-RPC style)
- Any framework can participate (ADK, LangGraph, CrewAI, custom) if it implements the protocol

### Important clarification

A2A does **not** remove the need for orchestration; it changes where orchestration can happen.

You can have:
- A central orchestrator delegating to remote agents via A2A
- Decentralized peer-to-peer networks with no single orchestrator

## 6. How This Repo Maps to the Concepts

### LangGraph side

- `m3_langgraph_multiagents/langgraph_flow.py`
  - Explicit node/edge orchestration with shared state

### ADK side

- `m4_adk_multiagents/buyer_adk.py`
- `m4_adk_multiagents/seller_adk.py`
  - `LlmAgent` + `MCPToolset` + `Runner` (OpenAI model via ADK provider-style id)
- `m4_adk_multiagents/a2a_protocol_http_orchestrator.py`
  - HTTP buyer/seller orchestration loop with ADK session-state tracking

### A2A side

- `m4_adk_multiagents/a2a_protocol_seller_server.py`
- `m4_adk_multiagents/a2a_protocol_buyer_client_demo.py`
  - True protocol-level A2A transport between agents

## 7. Key Takeaways

- LangGraph = explicit graph-based orchestration, single framework
- Google ADK = agent runtime framework (can be hierarchical orchestration, or standalone agents behind protocols)
- A2A = interoperability protocol for cross-framework, cross-system communication
- Module 4 approach in this repo = ADK-backed buyer/seller agents + HTTP A2A boundary + orchestrator loop
- A2A is complementary to LangGraph/ADK orchestration, not a replacement
